Dramatis is a simple social simulation framework for for simulationist story telling. It handles all the complexities of character AI and decision making, allowing the user to focus on creating character behaviors. Dramatis adapts much of it's design from previous simulationist storytelling tools such as [Versu](https://versu.com/), [Comme il Faut (CIF)](https://eis.ucsc.edu/papers/CognitionAndCreativity-JoshMcCoy-DAC09-Revised_0.pdf), [Kismet](https://github.com/adamsumm/Kismet), [Ensemble](https://github.com/ensemble-engine/ensemble), and [Neighborly](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly). Dramatis is meant to be a simple sandbox that provides Python classes and functions to build micro-story-worlds where characters interact with each other, and navigate social relationships.

> [!Note]
> I created Dramatis as a last-minute dissertation project. It does not have the extensive tests that my other projects have. I do my best to document the code and provide enough examples to help you understand what is going on.

## 🔥 Installation

You can install Dramatis directly from GitHub.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ShiJbey/dramatis.git
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

The best way to get started is by running the samples. Customizing your own simulation will involve many of the same steps.
